            <p>
                The girl is too adorable, and has a 1000 reasons at least, to be loved <br><br>
                
                To truly understand how deeply you're loved, you have to stay tuned and wait patiently. <br>
                Someone as special as you deserves more than just a few words—your qualities, your kindness, and the way you brighten the world are endless. <br>
                If I were to list everything I love about you, it would take an entire book, and even then, I might not capture it all. <br><br>
                
                It feels impossible to express in sentences what my heart feels every time I think of you. <br>
                But here are just a few silly, sweet reasons why I love you: <br><br>
                
                1. The way you laugh at the smallest things, turning ordinary moments into something magical. <br><br>
                
                2. How you’re always there with a kind word or a shoulder to lean on, even when you’re having a tough day yourself. <br><br>
                
                3. Your endless curiosity about the world, and how you never stop learning or asking questions. <br><br>
                
                4. The way you randomly hum your favorite songs when you're relaxed, it’s like a little melody of happiness. <br><br>
                
                5. Your love for animals and how you care for the smallest creatures as if they’re part of your family. <br><br>
                
                6. The way you overthink things but always manage to make the right decision in the end. <br><br>
                
                7. How your eyes light up. <br><br>
                
                8. The way you always remember the little things about me. <br>

                <p>You are too kind of a person <br>
                    You make this world a better place to live <br>
                    You haven't kissed <br>
                    You healed me & pulled me out of depression <br>
                    You haven't visited Edinburgh yet <br>
                    You haven't dated Lal yet <br>
                    You still have to go to Italy, and listen to Italian jazz while eating Italian food <br>
                    You haven't fucked <br>
                    You have to become one of the best lawyers <br>
